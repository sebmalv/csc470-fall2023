My game is based around a story which asks the main character to defeat the sun in order to restore corn to the people!
The purpose of this game is not only to leisurely enjoy but also to practice Poton, an indigenous language of the Lenca people. Poton has very few resources, especially interactive ones-- making the game one of a kind.
It first begins with a start menu, this menu allows the user to review the dictionary of the words that will be used in the game as well as view the purpose statement.

As you can see here are the three main screen buttons.
Here is both the purpose statement and the dictionary to study.

The dictionary on the main menu allows for it to be closed at the users convenience as you can see with the close button

Once the user decides to start the game there is a small intro scene which communicates what the goal is to the user, as well as who the main boss will be.

The player will venture through a small corridor within the forest, running into bushes everywhich way! There are 4 majors bushes that push the character into battle with a randomized selection of animals for each one. Each bush must be completed before moving on, the player does not have to win them but will lose Jade (the games currency) if they are unable to get the right animal in two tries.

These bushes, when collided with, sends the user into the battle scene! Here the user will be presented with the Poton name of the correct animal to shoot. They click on the button infront of the creature to drop the arrows above it.

However, if the user does not guess correctly, they are allowed one more shot! They are also informed of what the animal they shot is actually called in Poton.

Additionally, if the user has enough Jade they can use it to access the ingame dictionary to give themselves a more likely chance of getting it right.
Once the user has completed the four bush trials, they are able to persevere forward into the cave at the end of the road.

This cave leads the player to a village where two villagers will be present. These individuals will quiz the player using riddles that need Poton words as an answer.

The prompts used are randomly selected each time a player runs into a villager. The player picks the option he chooses through buttons. If the player guesses correctly, he receives some jade! He is allotted two tries before the villager gives up.

Once the player has been quizzed he can move forward through the cave to the final boss!
The final boss battle works similar to that of the animal battles, however, the language is focused around the Bosses body. The player must click the body parts in the order they are asked to, every single wrong answer knocks health off of the player. Every wrong answer knocks health off of the Boss.

If the players health falls to zero, they are repopulated to the village. Once again, they must answer the villagers. This allows the player to practice some more before returning to boss battle as well as collect some jade to populate the dictionary during the boss battle!
If the player does win, they are presented with the closing scene that lets them know they have returned corn to the people as well as how many questions they got right and how much Jade was collected.

Once the player is presented with their score results, they are sent back to the menu screen with a clean slate. Here they can either exit or try again!
