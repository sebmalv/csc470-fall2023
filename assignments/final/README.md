                Game Design Document

Game Purpose/Description:
    The purpose of this game is to allow individuals to practice our native language in a more interactive and enjoyable way. For example, the player will have battles with multiple animals and in order to win it must shoot the animal that corresponds to the native word provided by the game. If the player does not shoot the right animal, health will be removed. If he does, he wins the battle and earns points (corn, meat, hyde, or jade depending upon the animal). Another example would be the game asking to shoot the boss in the head (using our word for head), if the player does not know what that means and shoots the boss in the leg they will lose the battle and have to restart. If they do it correctly, they will win. 
It will follow a main character that the player will be able to move and jump depending on where they are. This player will only be able to move within certain bounds to ensure the player stays on the path to the end and does not get confused on where to go. The player will shoot animals/bosses with a bow and arrow that will have a reload meter. In battle, the player will also have a special attack which depends on the helper animal they choose at the beginning of the game. This special attack will be used through a UI button. Additionally, the player will have a health meter during boss battles. The player will be able to replenish their health by collecting corn that will be randomly placed throughout the game or purchased at certain homes. On the other hand, the player can also heal themselves by eating the collectibles certain animals may drop. The currency within the game will be measured with an actual number count, this number will only appear when the player wishes to purchase something. The currency, visually, will be represented by jade which the player will collect in every boss battle or animal hunting. The main goal of this game is to get as many words throughout it right as well as to complete the entire story and end the boss. As this game is meant to be helpful to individuals who are not fluent in our language, there will be an in-game dictionary that can be accessed for a certain amount of in-game currency. It will also be available before the game starts to allow the user to review. Additionally, certain characters will be able to provide assistance for jade or as dialogue. Some plants/objects will also show their native name when clicked.

Input:
    The game will receive inputs in a variety of ways. Such as:
UI special attack buttons
In text responses to other characters
Arrow keys
Space bar to jump
Clicking certain characters/areas
Visual Style:
    I am hoping to create a game that is very upbeat in appearance. The color/style will follow something similar to that of Pokemon games [Example 1]. However, I will attempt to incorporate art that appears as our traditional art does [Example 2].
    Example 1:
​​


    Example 2:



Audio: 
    The audio style will be similar to that of minecraft where sounds only happen during certain cases (ie: battle sounds, arrow going through air sound, animal sounds). 

Story:
    This game will follow the main player, Quetzalcoatl, who is sent on a journey by the Moon (Metzi) to learn as much of our native language as possible in order to bring Corn back to humanity before defeating the Sun (Tunal) who has stolen it away. Before beginning his journey he will pick his spirit animal to assist him. He will go on a journey through the deep rainforest on a set path, having random encounters with animals who he must differentiate from one another in order to move forward in his journey. On his way to the Sun, he will stop by two villages where he will be asked questions involving his native language and must respond appropriately. After his long journey, he arrives to the cave where the sun has hidden away the corn and he must defeat it by attacking specific areas on his body that will only be mentioned in his native tongue. If he gets it wrong, he must restart the battle. Finally, once the sun has been defeated corn will grow everywhere and he will know much more about his people!

Targets:

Low End:
The character will be moveable and only one boss will be made. The visuals may not exactly match the style but fit the color scheme. There will only be one village with only 3 interactable inhabitants. The player will only be able to walk on the designated path. There will only be 5 events where the character is quizzed on our language aside from the final boss battle. There will only be 3 spirit animals at the beginning. There will be only one special attack that can be used. There will be very limited audio.
Desired:
The character will be moveable and have to fight at least 2 major bosses. The visuals semi-match the style and fit perfectly into the color scheme. There will be two villages each having random non-required collectables. There will be many more random jade throughout the game. There will be at least 10 events where the character is quizzed on the language aside from the final boss battle. There will be 4 spirit animals to choose from at the start. There will be at least two special attacks that can be used. The character will have to stay on path but villages are open to exploration. All important events will involve some degree of audio. There will be an entrance menu to review the dictionary before the game begins. 
Above and Beyond:
The character will be moveable and fight at least 3 bosses. The visuals, audio, and color scheme will all coincide, even some words being pronounced by game instead of merely presented. There will be more open world paths the player can take to practice more. There will be at least 15 events where the player is quizzed on the language aside from the final boss battle. There will be 5 spirit animals to choose from at the start who will all have difference special attacks. All the village characters will be open to dialogue. There will be a mini game where you can quiz yourself randomly on the words within the dictionary.

TimeLine:
 11/30- 12/8: Implement core mechanics, get all meters to be able to function. Set up singleton pattern for game manager. Look for potential ways to make the art style more coinciding with our traditional art

12/08-12/10: Implement any potential visuals that are better than the previous. Construct the final boss battle, add audio, create villages

12/10-12/13: Improve any bugs, test trials, make trailer/website and finish one pager

12/13-12/15: Edit bugs, fix any issues, try to hit the above and beyond where possible
